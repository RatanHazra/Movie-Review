# Movie-Review
 Movie reviews are an important way to gauge the performance of a movie. While providing a numerical/stars rating to a movie tells us about the success or failure of a movie quantitatively, a collection of movie reviews is what gives us a deeper qualitative insight on different aspects of the movie. A textual movie review tells us about the the strong and weak points of the movie and deeper analysis of a movie review can tell us if the movie in general meets the expectations of the reviewer. Viewers will be able to post their review for any movie. They also will be able to give reting for any movie.
